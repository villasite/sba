SBA's own Phillip Armstrong, as part of [MOSAIC](https://www.mosaic-soul.com/) group, performed the St. Benedict the Afrcan original mass music on Sunday April 7, 2019.

As part of the Saint Benedict the African feast day celebration, which fell on a Thursday but was celebrated on the following Sunday, the nine singers of MOSAIC performed the musical pieces composed by Dr. Kevin Johnson.
Dr. Johnson, the associate professor of music at Spelman College, performed the composition in April 2018 along with the Spelman glee club, which Dr. Johnson also directs.

The MOSAIC group had been preparing this presentation since 2018 while also rehearsing for a separate performance held in February 2019.
Mr. Armstrong nonetheless felt it was appropriate to perform this unique special composition for Saint Benedict the African, his home parish.
