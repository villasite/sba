The mid-point of Lent is hopefully a turning point. Turning away from the darkness and into the light. Turning away from the fear and towards the hope. In some sense it should be like we were being led and now beginning to walk freely, to follow closely, without requiring a push or a pull. Our minds our made up, our eye is on the prize and we are going all the way.

As the young folks would say, “Ride or die!” Or as the old folks would say, “Keep your lamps trimmed and burning.”

Lent is a journey, not a destination. It is designed so that we move with the Lord and with that practice, we grow more and more faithful and able to fit into this church that he is forming and commissioning. We become more able to do something with Holy Water besides dab it quickly. The better we practice and grow during Lent, the better we bless! The better we serve! The better we do in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

Conveniently, this halfway point is where we can start to see the glass as half full and the impossibility of the glass being empty. We begin to focus more intently on The Great Getting Up Morning of Easter.

At this point we know that the Lord is asking for a commitment. We know that we are agreeing to be changed, fixed and readied to go out and tell the world what God did and what God said.

At this point, by design, we start to sound like the Lord. This is of great assistance to the Lord as he prepares for what comes next.
