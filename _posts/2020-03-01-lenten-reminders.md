## More Praying...More Fasting...More Giving

It might be more accurate to say that there is the "forty day fast within Lent." Historically, Lent has varied from a week to three weeks to the present configuration of 46 days. The forty day fast, however, has been more stable.

The Sundays are certainly part of the Time of Lent, but they are not prescribed days of fast and abstinence. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory days of fasting and abstinence for Catholics. In addition, Fridays during Lent are obligatory days of of abstinence.

For members of the Latin Catholic Church, the norms on fasting are obligatory from age 18 until age 59. 

When fasting, a person is permitted to eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal.

The norms concerning abstinence from meat are binding upon members of the Latin Catholic Church form age 14 onwards.

Those that are excused from fast and abstinence outside the age limits include the physically or mentally ill including individuals suffering from chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Also excluded are pregnant or nursing women. 

In all cases, common sense should prevail, and ill persons should not further jeopardize their health by fasting.
