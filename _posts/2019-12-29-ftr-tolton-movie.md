Join the Archdiocese of Chicago and the local community for a screening of the movie Across, the feature film story of Father Augustine Tolton. The screening will feature the first 36 minutes of the movie as a stand-alone short film, which tells the story of little Gus's successfully attempted escape from slavery in 1863 with his family. The movie features the Tolton family and little Gus and brings them to life through the big screen.
