<p class="text-danger">If you keep palm branches in your home, hold them at the outside doorways of the house and wave them during the first Gospel, proclaimed at the beginning of Mass, which commemorates the Lord's entrance into Jerusalem.</p> If you have no palms, you could get a branch from a bush outside your home. *This ritual takes the place of the introductory rites. After this, the first reading will be proclaimed.*
