The Tolton ambassadors’ charge is to "actively promote the Cause for the Canonization of Father Augustus Tolton." This past month on June 12th, the canonization for Father Tolton was advanced as he received the title “Venerable." 

Some Saint Benedict the African parishioners are part of the many other ambassadors from across the country who are working in pushing the cause forward. Visit the <a href="https://tolton.archchicago.org/" target="_blank">Chicago Father Augustus Tolton webpage</a> for more information.
