			<p>The Council of Catholic Women choose four causes of 2020-21. The four areas of focus are:</p>
			<ol class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<h3><b>Domestic Violence</b></h3>
					<p>The Domestic Violence Committee attended several zoom meetings during 2020.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold"><b>Books for Women in Prison</b></h3>
					<p>In the past the CCW collected over 100 paperback books, dictionaries, word search/crossword puzzles and calendars. Donations went to <a href="https://chicagobwp.org" target="_blank">Chicago Books for Women in Prison</a> located at 4511 N. Hermitage Ave. Chicago, IL 60640 This organization collects, packs and ships books to prisons in eight states.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold"><b>Mothers and the importance of Breast-feeding</b></h3> 
					<p>This is a new initiative that CCW will be exploring; ways to reach out to new mothers in support of nurturing their children through breast-feeding.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold"><b>USO</b></h3>
					<p>The National Council of Catholic Women (NCCW) supports the <a href="https://www.uso.org" target="_blank">United Service Organization (USO)</a>. CCW gives financial support annually to the USO.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4><b>Other Annual Initiatives:</b></h4>
			<ol class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<p><b>Coat Drive-</b> Due to COVID restrictions this initiative was not performed in 2020. It is the hope of the CCW that this initiative will be picked up again in 2021.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<p><b>A Toy Drive-</b>The CCW collected various toy items: puzzles, books trucks, cars, dolls, games as well as
						hats, gloves socks and gift cards. Thanks to the generosity of St. Benedict the African parish members, the CCW donated half the toys to The Imani House and the other half of the toy collection was donated to <a href="https://www.margaretsvillage.org/" target="_blank">Margaret’s Village</a>.</p>

				<h3><b>Domestic Violence Awareness</b></h3>
				<p>
					In past years the CCW distributed Purple ribbons, information notices, and cards each Sunday in October. The CCW held a candlelight circle of prayer for the victims and perpetrators of domestic violence. We distributed candles to each parishioner and in August 2019 organized an awareness movie called The Hunting Ground. This movie was a workshop for college-bound students and their parents.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Women's Workshop</b></h3>
				<p>
					CCW conducted two workshops in the past and look forward to planning a Women’s Retreat and Mass. Retreat date TBD in 2021.
				</p>
				<h3><b>Tithing</b></h3>
				<p>
					Over half of the members of CCW have made the commitment to tithe a tenth of their earnings, as a way to give consistent financial support to the parish. Each member has also pledged $180.00 this year in order to meet the goal of $2,000.00 as an end of the year gift to the parish. We do this to alleviate the need for fund raising.

					The matriarchs of our church have helped us to learn, to grow and to love. They have shown us the way, just as the Blessed Mother shows us the way to her son. In the May Crowning we honor the Blessed Mother for the gift of life, love and the true meaning of sacrifice. In answer to this great sacrifice we say:
				</p>
				<blockquote class="text-center">
				  	<p><b>“Hail, Mary full of Grace. The Lord is with thee.<br>Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.<br>Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. AMEN.”</b></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>A mother is not a woman who breeds, but a woman who knows how to sacrifice...</p>
				<p>Thank you to the Women of the CCW for always having a mission and goal of expectation to strive toward. All of you have sacrificed for others.</p>
				<p>Thank you to Sr. Mary and Sister Joanne for your endless support and sacrifice.</p>
				<p>Thank you to all the Women of St. Benedict the African for your contributions in raising a village and your work for the Lord.</p>
