    <p>We meet each Sunday and learn about the Mass, sacraments in general but especially the Eucharist, Church and what it means to belong to it, what the values of Jesus are and what it means to be a Catholic Christian.</p>
    <p>We pray that First Communion will be the beginning of a lifetime of receiving Communion.</p>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate all First Communion requests. <b>Please contact us by email or phone.</b></p>
