  <p>At the river I will stand</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know what to say today</p>

<p>So I called on the ancestors</p>

<p>And asked what is there left to say</p>

<p>It seems to me that everything has been said</p>

<p>I cannot speak to what has not been heard</p>

<p>But what is there to say and to whom do I need to say what?</p>

<p>And Thomas Dorsey came to the ambo</p>

<p>And of course, if Uncle Tommy came</p>

<p>Miss Lena McLin sent him</p>

<p>I wanted to, Lord know I tried, I wanted today‚Äôs sermon to be from</p>

<p>Deborah Cox‚Äôs sermon Nobody‚Äôs Supposed to Be Here</p>

<p>But young folks have to give way to the wisdom of old folks</p>

<p>Especially when old hate is in the air.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>We have come over a way that with tears that has been watered</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>We have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered</p>

<p>The blood of the Lamb</p>

<p>The blood on the hands of Pontius Pilate</p>

<p>The blood of the majority</p>

<p>The blood of drugs</p>

<p>The blood of mass incarceration</p>

<p>The blood of police brutality</p>

<p>The blood of murdered</p>

<p>The blood of the martyrs</p>

<p>The blood of people killed for sport</p>

<p>But let us be clear and let us not forget although they were killed,</p>

<p>we die for freedom</p>

<p>we die for Christ sake.</p>

<p>we die for God sake.</p>

<p>Understand this</p>

<p>When that boy put his knee on that man‚Äôs neck</p>

<p>Jesus showed up and took the place of the man</p>

<p>And Jesus said to the boy</p>

<p>You don‚Äôt want to do this, find yourself, find your religion</p>

<p>And rise up!</p>

<p>And the boy refused to rise.</p>

<p>Jesus said, I have died for your sins and the sins of your brother at no charge and so there is no sin here</p>

<p>Not in the counter fit bill</p>

<p>Not in the 911 call</p>

<p>Not in the police training manual</p>

<p>Not in the city‚Äôs history</p>

<p>There is no sin here, YET.</p>

<p>You have been given the power</p>

<p>Your sin is forgiven</p>

<p>Let it go.</p>

<p>But the boy squeezed his sin and held on to it more tightly</p>

<p>And the boy didn‚Äôt listen to Jesus</p>

<p>Jesus begged, beseeched and begot, please, please, please, please</p>

<p>And the boy did not listen.</p>

<p>The boy would not turn away from his sin</p>

<p>The boy would not repent</p>

<p>The boy would not believe</p>

<p>He kept so busy showing off to show his people that he was a big man</p>

<p>Bragging, I can do whatever I want to do.</p>

<p>And Jesus asked him three times, do you love me</p>

<p>But the boy couldn‚Äôt answer because his momma didn‚Äôt put no religion in him</p>

<p>But he will answer to God.</p>

<p>And this is how we got here</p>

<p>Because of boys and girls who weren‚Äôt raised right</p>

<p>Who were taught to play church.</p>

<p>And pretend to be God</p>

<p>Trying to make all things all about me.</p>

<p>So Jesus, all day, every day, lifts his head to the heavens</p>

<p>Without moving his neck, that‚Äôs an amazing God</p>

<p>And he looks to his Father and he prays</p>

<p>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.</p>

<p>DRUMMING</p>

<p>And God showed up</p>

<p>And wiped away every tear</p>

<p>And took up every fragment of broken humanity</p>

<p>And every piece of lost community</p>

<p>And every drop of blood spilled</p>

<p>And every tear drop shed</p>

<p>And every ounce of fear prayed</p>

<p>And said</p>

<p>I got you</p>

<p>Hold my mule and</p>

<p>Hold my peace</p>

<p>You are going to need it in this world</p>

<p>Hold on</p>

<p>Keep your hand to the plow hold on</p>

<p>This is a hard row to hoe</p>

<p>So hold on</p>

<p>You may be tied, but don‚Äôt you get weary</p>

<p>I go to prepare a place for you</p>

<p>So that where I am,</p>

<p>You might be.</p>

<p>And that is why Black folks follow Jesus from the womb to the tomb,</p>

<p>Just to be in this world like God wants to be in this world.</p>

<p>Jesus made Pentecost happen for the church so that the good folks</p>

<p>Could live in peace</p>

<p>Pray in peace</p>

<p>And rest in peace.</p>

<p>While it is tempting to hold the mule of Jesus and get in and fight for</p>

<p>Community policing that is not about how many people can you lock up and when can you kill them.</p>

<p>Community policing should be, if someone would tell the truth, rooted in understanding that we need help being community because one of us wants to be superior.</p>

<p>One of us wants a gun for hunting human beings</p>

<p>And one of us wants a gun for protection from the hunters.</p>

<p>It is tempting to get into the fight where laws are being written, lines are being drawn and health care is being practiced so that the right people die.</p>

<p>And we can watch the murder and either be entertained or be terrorized.</p>

<p>This is the world that Jesus had to come to</p>

<p>This is the humanity he had to be born into</p>

<p>This is the death he had to suffer</p>

<p>This is the life he had to rise from,</p>

<p>From the life of the dead.</p>

<p>Jesus, knowing all things,</p>

<p>Gave this dying world of murderers a church</p>

<p>In order to give the people who are wrong</p>

<p>A chance to rise up and live the life of the living.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs be clear on what God knew in the beginning</p>

<p>Whenever you see Black people aborted</p>

<p>Whenever you see Black people enslaved</p>

<p>Whenever you see Black people shot down</p>

<p>In the street, in corporate America, in the White House, the Congress,</p>

<p>In court or in church</p>

<p>You are seeing why God gave this dying world a church and set it on fire!</p>

<p>Pentecost is saying to the church</p>

<p>Quit saying</p>

<p>If you white you are alright</p>

<p>If you are brown stick around</p>

<p>And if you are black get back</p>

<p>Because that is not what Jesus said.</p>

<p>What Jesus said was</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeace be with you.</p>

<p>As the Father has sent me, so I send you.‚Äù</p>

<p>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,</p>

<p>‚ÄúReceive the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them,</p>

<p>and whose sins you retain are retained.‚Äù</p>

<p>And do this in remembrance of me.</p>

<p>Give up the fear in order to not give up that power.</p>

<p>Give up the fear, embrace the power.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the message of Pentecost</p>

<p>50 days after Easter in the pandemic of 2020</p>

<p>Trust and believe</p>

<p>God is not dead</p>

<p>And God is not done.</p>

<p>And he is sending His fire to the earth, by ways and means of his church</p>

<p>To get people off the necks</p>

<p>Off the backs</p>

<p>Off the toes</p>

<p>And off the last good nerve of Black folks</p>

<p>He came as a little Jewish boy</p>

<p>But he rises from the dead like a Black man</p>

<p>That is the faith that gives hope to the world.</p>

<p>Keep remembering that the only reason Jesus came to earth was because innocent people were being killed.</p>

<p>Keep remember Church we have seen this before and we know how this ends.</p>

<p>Some of us in heaven and some of us in hell</p>

<p>We always have to thank God for the ones who made it</p>

<p>And pray for the ones whose suffering will never end</p>

<p>Because they choose to love hate instead of loving God.</p>

<p>They choose to cling to the ideal of self instead of clinging to the old rugged cross.  Their suffering will never end.</p>

<p>Run this race on the straight and narrow and you will hear Jesus say</p>

<p>Good bye forever to those who insist on their right to sin</p>

<p>Well done to those who tried to love the other</p>

<p>And I tried to God the Father.</p>

<p>And once again, you will join your voice to the voice of those who can always say AMEN!</p>
