I"Ÿ<h1 id="online-mass">Online Mass</h1>

<p>Thank you for deciding to virtually join us for Sunday Mass at St. Benedict the African. Due to the temporary parish closure stemming from COVID-19 and the need to continue celebrating Mass as community, St. Benedict the African has decided to use the Zoom video conference platform to bring the Mass from the parish building to you.</p>

<p>Please refer to the following guidance to assist your connection experience.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re calling from a landline or non-smartphone, dial 312.626.6799 and enter the Meeting ID 979 480 457# when prompted.</p>

<h2 id="before-connecting">Before Connecting</h2>
<p>The following steps are for a video-enabled device:</p>

<p>Ahead of time,Â download Zoom:Â https://www.zoom.us/download</p>

<p>Youâ€™re likely to have the best experience on a tablet or laptop, but youâ€™re able to download an app on your phone as well.</p>

<p>## 
On the day of,Â either click on the meeting link (https://bit.ly/SBAparishMass) or enter the meeting ID after loading the app. Meeting ID: 979 480 457</p>

<p>There are two viewÂ options, which you can control at the top right of the screen. â€œSpeaker Viewâ€ will have the person speaking with the biggest video, in this case, theÂ folks in the sanctuary. The other option is â€œGallery Viewâ€ which allows you to see everyone participating in the Mass, Brady Bunch style.</p>

<p>Our default will be to have everyone on the call muted, as there will be many people, some with background noise, in order to maximize everyoneâ€™s Mass experience. If youâ€™d like to raise an issue, or contribute an intention, please utilize the chat function, which you can access through the bottom right of your screen.</p>

<p>Given that we expect a number of people to join us, you may experience the video or audio feed as choppy at times, this is normal &amp; please be patient as we continue to smooth out all the bumps in the road.</p>
