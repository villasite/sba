<p>Jeremiah’s parents, Shawnece and JR, were married at Saint Benedict the African and are active participants in the parish. Their first son Jamil received his first communion in 2016. Both children were baptized at Saint Benedict the African.</p>

<p>Shawnece says “You don’t have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great.”  And Jeremiah has started!</p>

<p>Epiphania Olorunkemi (Kemi) and her mother Josephine are not only new parishioners, but new neighbors as well. They moved to the Englewood community in 2018 from New Jersey. They found Saint Benedict the African as they walked the neighborhood and decided to visit one day. They have remained since.</p>

<p>Josephine says “I thank God and the church of St. Benedict the African for this special day, and the event of Epiphania Olorunkemi’s First Holy Communion. Her desire to know and love Jesus is fulfilled. Congratulations to Kemi! Congratulations, Jeremiah!”</p>

<p>Their instructor, Sister Joanne, says “we meet each Sunday and learn about the Mass, sacraments in general but especially Eucharist, Church and what it means to belong to it, what the values of Jesus are and what it means to be a Catholic Christian.</p>

<p>We pray and study together and anticipate happily the day when we begin participating more fully at Mass. We pray that First Communion will be the beginning of a lifetime of receiving Communion.”</p>
