I"€<p>While attending a Mass recently I was distracted by one of the priests who decided to dance a two-step during the procession. I thought, â€œLook at Fr. X hot dogging.â€ Later, while talking to a woman who was at the same Mass she commented on how great the Mass was, she was especially thrilled by Father Xâ€™s dancing down the aisle. I thought, â€œTHERE IS THE PROBLEM!!!â€</p>
