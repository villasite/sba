I"ì#<p>Today is a happy day for Jesus</p>

<p>Because two of his disciples finally got it.</p>

<p>They were on the road to Emmaus</p>

<p>Walking and talking about church stuff</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what we, the church, are supposed to do.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Small minds talk about people</p>

<p>Average minds talk about events</p>

<p>Great minds talk about ideas</p>

<p>Minds stayed on Jesus talk about church stuff.</p>

<p>We are supposed to talk about church stuff</p>

<p>All on the news is corona virus stuff</p>

<p>All in the prayer should be healing stuff, saving stuff, living stuff, sharing stuff because all that</p>

<p>stuff is church stuff.</p>

<p>And when we are caught talking about church stuff</p>

<p>In our private prayer</p>

<p>In our common prayer</p>

<p>In our parish organization meetings</p>

<p>And definitely in our conversations with the pastor</p>

<p>When we are talking about church stuff</p>

<p>Jesus comes.</p>

<p>And Jesus appeared on the road</p>

<p>And started walking with them</p>

<p>And got all into their conversation</p>

<p>Because it was His Father‚Äôs conversation.</p>

<p>Church it happens every time</p>

<p>Yesterday, today and tomorrow</p>

<p>When we are talking about church stuff</p>

<p>And doing church stuff</p>

<p>Jesus appears in our midst</p>

<p>And leads our conversation</p>

<p>Leads our prayer</p>

<p>Leads our work.</p>

<p>If Jesus doesn‚Äôt appear</p>

<p>We are not talking about church stuff</p>

<p>We may be talking loud</p>

<p>We may be speaking our minds</p>

<p>We may be making a point</p>

<p>We may be having our say</p>

<p>But if we are not talking about church stuff</p>

<p>We are missing the opportunity God has provided.</p>

<p>Pandemics, wars, death, disease, and destruction are all moments to talk about church stuff because sometimes in life,</p>

<p>You have to have a funeral. And you need good religion in order to plan a good funeral.</p>

<p>But so are times of birth and life, moments of peace and joy, clean water and clean air, music,</p>

<p>laughter and love, because sometimes in life, you have to plan a celebration.</p>

<p>And if we are not talking about church stuff, we will plan every event as a reception, just come,</p>

<p>eat, drink, be happy and be merry</p>

<p>And we will miss the opportunity to join in life with God and what God is doing now.</p>

<p>My niece told my nephew about a show on Netflix that she highly recommended. I asked her why she didn‚Äôt tell me about the show?</p>

<p>She responded, ‚ÄúBecause you are a priest.‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>

<p>She continued by explaining that it‚Äôs a show about a woman who is a drug king pin, I guess she would be a drug queen pin.</p>

<p>I told my niece you need to get back to church</p>

<p>Because according to your way of thinking Netflix is going to limit you with people you respect</p>

<p>and entertain you with murder, drugs and crimes ‚Äì things that snatch the life out of you.</p>

<p>Church Jesus is not going to come and talk to you about your favorite TV shows, but he‚Äôs got an</p>

<p>inquiring mind because he‚Äôs got to report back to a higher power and when Our Father ask</p>

<p>Our Brother, what are they talking about, he‚Äôs not going to lie for us.</p>

<p>He died for us, but he will not lie for us.</p>

<p>In the mystagogia, you move from talking about the pain in your house</p>

<p>The pain in your joints</p>

<p>The pain in your relationship</p>

<p>To talking about Jesus.</p>

<p>You know the smart kids play where in the world is Waldo?</p>

<p>Well the smart Christians ask where in the world is Jesus?</p>

<p>That is mystagogia!</p>

<p>When you start wondering and wandering</p>

<p>Looking for Jesus</p>

<p>Where is the Lord in all this pain?</p>

<p>Where is the Lord when these bills are all piled up?</p>

<p>Where is the Lord when this man keeps not doing right by me?</p>

<p>The mystagogia kicks in when you can be your honest self,</p>

<p>Not the polite version of who you are.</p>

<p>And you can honestly say</p>

<p>Father, I need help, because my sister has injured me and I need to find a way to forgive her.</p>

<p>And Jesus steps in and says I am the way.</p>

<p>Father, I stretch my hand to Thee, no other help do I know.</p>

<p>And Jesus steps in and says take my hand</p>

<p>Father, I need Thee every hour, especially when my child tells me that same lie he has been
telling all of his life.</p>

<p>And Jesus steps in and says I am the truth.</p>

<p>Father, I am weak, I am worn, I am down, I am lost</p>

<p>And Jesus steps in and says, I am the light.</p>

<p>When we allow our religion to kick in</p>

<p>Then Jesus kicks in</p>

<p>And allows our baptism to kick in</p>

<p>And that is when the conversations in life are changed and changing.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when the battle is over.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when the breakthrough happens</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when the doors are opened</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when we put aside the bad things</p>

<p>And take hold of the good things</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when we stop contributing to our own demise</p>

<p>And start contributing to our sisters and brothers in Christ Jesus</p>

<p>Redistributing our energy so we</p>

<p>First give honor to God</p>

<p>And watch Netflix when God gets through with me.</p>

<p>They felt like going on</p>

<p>And that is the effect that the Lord is always hoping for</p>

<p>The Lord is speaking to somebody right here and right now</p>

<p>And He is saying</p>

<p>I want you to feel like going on</p>

<p>We want Jesus to feel our pain</p>

<p>And let us come into this house and</p>

<p>Sing nobody knows the trouble I‚Äôve seen but Jesus</p>

<p>And Jesus nods to the choir</p>

<p>And gives approval to the chorus</p>

<p>And then looks to the choir master</p>

<p>And signals</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs move on</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs change the tune</p>

<p>Because the Lord is not here to review troubles</p>

<p>The Lord is here to view the assembly that wants to see what the end shall be.</p>

<p>Jesus sings I feel like going on</p>

<p>And that is what the Lord wanted for the disciples on the road to Emmaus</p>

<p>And that is what the Lord wants for you and me</p>

<p>To feel like going on.</p>

<p>When we feel like going on</p>

<p>We stop talking about the same old problems</p>

<p>And we talk about a brand-new day</p>

<p>When we feel like going on</p>

<p>We stop visiting yesterday</p>

<p>And start dance, dance, dancing all night</p>

<p>So that when joy come in the morning</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt look like</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt feel like</p>

<p>I am out of church shape</p>

<p>I feel like and look like I‚Äôve been waiting on the Lord</p>

<p>To come by here and sup with me</p>

<p>So, when God gets through with me</p>

<p>I shall come forth like pure gold!</p>

<p>We get communion when the Lord comes</p>

<p>Not when the priest comes.</p>

<p>I have told this story a million times because it helps me understand church.</p>

<p>We were at the end of Mass and big, old, tall Nigel Lyles started his own procession to the
presider‚Äôs chair</p>

<p>And I looked for an usher to tackle him, but no usher was paying attention and Nigel came right</p>

<p>up on me and whispered</p>

<p>I need communion.</p>

<p>And I said, we just had communion.</p>

<p>He said I stepped out of Mass and I missed communion</p>

<p>But I can‚Äôt leave without communion.</p>

<p>So, I got up and gave Nigel communion</p>

<p>But clearly, he received Jesus.</p>

<p>There we were having a conversation about church stuff</p>

<p>And Jesus came, not by ritual, not by design, not by accident,</p>

<p>But because people had been talking to a teenager about church stuff,</p>

<p>He received the risen Lord and would not leave without him.</p>

<p>Church let‚Äôs not miss the irony in today‚Äôs story.</p>

<p>Two people were going the wrong way</p>

<p>Because God was not through with them yet.</p>

<p>But even though they were going the wrong way,</p>

<p>They were talking about church stuff and Jesus came</p>

<p>And turned them around</p>

<p>And brought them back to Jerusalem</p>

<p>Brought them back to where God was doing things</p>

<p>That would change their lives and change the world.</p>

<p>As always, let us look forward to when from our exile, God brings us home again, via Zoom, via
Pace, via CTA, via Uber, doesn‚Äôt matter how he does it.</p>

<p>What matters is that God has given us time to talk about church stuff.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs be sure we don‚Äôt social distance from God</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs just use our cell phones, computers and cable channels differently.</p>

<p>That show about the queen pin drug dealer could have had some church scenes in it. The only
reason it didn‚Äôt is because the writers weren‚Äôt talking about church stuff.</p>

<p>It could have been a better show with Jesus in it. Thank God all we have to do is receive His
Son into our homes and our hearts in order to have a better life.</p>

<p>Happy Easter! This is the Season of Rising! We are not waiting on a day without disease; We are</p>

<p>waiting on our life time with Risen Christ. Alleluia!</p>
