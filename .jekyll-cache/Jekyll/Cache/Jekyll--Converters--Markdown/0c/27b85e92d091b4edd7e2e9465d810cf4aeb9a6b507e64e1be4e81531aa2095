I"h<p>The people needed a Good Shepherd. And so, Jesus came from heaven to earth. If you want to live right you have to always put God in the picture. Today is Sunday and this particular Sunday is a chance to put God in your fourth week of Easter.
<!--more--></p>

<p>For some people today is just another day</p>

<p>But for those whose eyes are watching God</p>

<p>Today is a day to greet God with a rousing Happy Easter</p>

<p>A day to celebrate that He would not come down off the cross</p>

<p>Just to save himself,</p>

<p>But he rose from the dead just to save me.</p>

<p>Put God in the picture</p>

<p>And today is not just Sunday</p>

<p>Rather it is the first day of a brand-new week</p>

<p>Where God has given some a moment, some 604,800 seconds</p>

<p>to live.  Sunday tells us just focus on this week.</p>

<p>Just try to walk with Jesus</p>

<p>And talk with Jesus</p>

<p>Moment by moment</p>

<p>One day at a time</p>

<p>And let God lead your life this week.</p>

<p>The hard part is letting go and letting God.</p>

<p>Truth be told, we want to do what we want to do</p>

<p>And more grandly, we don’t want to do, what we don’t want to do.</p>

<p>And then comes God, always asking us to do something.</p>

<p>Even as we stay at home on a Sunday</p>

<p>The church is open and God is asking us to do something.</p>

<p>This is the invitation that Jesus is extending to the Pharisees.</p>

<p>But they do not receive the Body of Christ.</p>

<p>He is a stranger to them</p>

<p>They do not recognize his voice</p>

<p>They will run away from him.</p>

<p>Jesus tells them there are thieves and robbers.</p>

<p>There are those who climb over the wall</p>

<p>And those who come in through the gate.</p>

<p>There is a shepherd</p>

<p>And there is a gatekeeper</p>

<p>There are those who recognize</p>

<p>And those who cannot see</p>

<p>And cannot hear on this glorious Sunday morning.</p>

<p>There are those who hear</p>

<p>And one who calls</p>

<p>And the one who calls, leads those who hear and recognize out</p>

<p>And the one who calls drives them out</p>

<p>He drives out all who are his own.</p>

<p>Jesus tells them all this Good News</p>

<p>But some don’t get it.</p>

<p>For them it’s just another week</p>

<p>But for the ones who receive the Good News</p>

<p>It’s a brand-new week</p>

<p>A fresh start to a bright future.</p>

<p>Take the fresh start church</p>

<p>Let the Lord use you</p>

<p>And receive a better week this week.</p>

<p>Because the Pharisees only wanted to do what they wanted to do</p>

<p>They missed the invitation that God in the person of Jesus</p>

<p>Extends to each one of us every day.</p>

<p>We are invited into the fold</p>

<p>We are invited into the community</p>

<p>And when we accept this invitation</p>

<p>We are invited to be led out and do the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Not led out to the bank</p>

<p>Not led out to the grocery store</p>

<p>Not led out to the doctor</p>

<p>The flock is the church</p>

<p>And those who recognize His voice</p>

<p>And follow His lead</p>

<p>Are being led out into the world</p>

<p>To bring the invitation and the blessing of God</p>

<p>To those who need to be saved from their sins.</p>

<p>If you want to live right</p>

<p>Put God in your picture frame and your door frame</p>

<p>And let him forgive your sin</p>

<p>So he can lead His church.</p>

<p>Eye has not seen, ear has not heard</p>

<p>What God has ready for those who are waiting on the Lord.</p>

<p>There is a movie called The Shack</p>

<p>And in The Shack</p>

<p>God is a Black woman</p>

<p>And she cooks!</p>

<p>And one day a man who has suffered a great loss</p>

<p>The loss of a child</p>

<p>Gets up the courage to confront this woman while she is in her kitchen cooking.</p>

<p>And he goes up and goes off</p>

<p>How in the world can you be stirring a pot?</p>

<p>When my child needed you</p>

<p>And when things kept getting worse</p>

<p>And bad stuff was happening to good people</p>

<p>And you are just standing there stirring a pot!</p>

<p>He yelled and screamed</p>

<p>And the woman kept stirring and smiled slightly</p>

<p>And said child, you have no idea how much I am doing right now.</p>

<p>Church, don’t ever underestimate God</p>

<p>God is always doing something</p>

<p>And when it feels like we have too much to bear</p>

<p>God is doing something extra special,</p>

<p>Extra good.</p>

<p>We may not know the details</p>

<p>But as long as we know the God,</p>

<p>We don’t have to worry about the devil in the details.</p>

<p>God is inviting the Pharisees, all of those who want to do what they want to do on their own</p>

<p>To join the flock.</p>

<p>Being in the flock is our blessing</p>

<p>Keeping in the flock is our work</p>

<p>Staying in the flock is our sacrament</p>

<p>Life is more abundant when it is life</p>

<p>Lived, shared and loved</p>

<p>With sisters and brothers in Christ Jesus</p>

<p>In the house of the Lord</p>

<p>And the heaven of our Father</p>

<p>That’s not about the after life</p>

<p>That’s about the life that begins when we</p>

<p>Reserve the right to serve</p>

<p>On the first day of a brand-new week</p>

<p>With an old time and on time God.</p>

<p>Be a better you this week than you were last week,</p>

<p>Meaning give God a little more time</p>

<p>And when God leads us out</p>

<p>We will be read, not for the troubles of the world</p>

<p>But rather for the goodness of the Lord.</p>
