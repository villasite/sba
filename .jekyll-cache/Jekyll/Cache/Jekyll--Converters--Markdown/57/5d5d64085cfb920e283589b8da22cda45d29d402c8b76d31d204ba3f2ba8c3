I"Ý<p>Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christianâ€™s life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.</p>
