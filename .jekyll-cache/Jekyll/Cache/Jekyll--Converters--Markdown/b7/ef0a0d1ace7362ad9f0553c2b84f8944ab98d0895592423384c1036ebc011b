I"û<p>Have you witnessed a full immersion baptism in the ten thousand gallon pool of holy water at Saint Benedict the African? Have you noticed the hearts present in all four stained glass windows of Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and Sister Thea Bowman? Even in the glass window of our patron saint, Saint Benedict the African?</p>

<p>Saint Benedict the African is one of the very few Catholic churches built in Chicago to serve a predominately African American community. Original artwork and architecture at this parish <strong>reflect black spirituality</strong> to continue inspiring Catholic worship. But this unique treasure is suffering from roof damage that is in need of your immediate help. <em>Can you provide your support?</em></p>

<p>The roof damage is located right above the baptismal pool but if left unattended can affect our <em>one-of-a-kind</em> African inspired hut worship space located right next to the baptismal pool. Meaning our Mass celebrations can be interrupted in the future. Or without proper roof repair, the <strong>eventual closure</strong> of the only Catholic church presence in Englewood.</p>

<p><strong>Can you contribute $55 to keep the roof up?</strong> That is the equivalent of a case of ceiling tiles. Your online giving will be processed through the GiveCentral website; a trusted online donation site that is secure and easy to use.</p>

<div class="text-center bottom-buffer"><a href="https://www.givecentral.org/SBABuildingCampaign" class="btn btn-primary btn-xl wow tada" target="_blank">Donate Now</a></div>

<p>Please know that <u>your gift is tax-deductible</u> and will ensure the church doors remain open for future visitors to experience black spirituality through the architecture, artwork, and liturgy. You will <em>not only</em> be lifting up the church roof but spirits of people who come to Saint Benedict the African to find a spiritual home.</p>

<p>Thank you from the entire community of Saint Benedict the African. <strong>Past, present, and future</strong>.</p>
