I"	<p>Mary of Magdala came to the tomb 
and saw the stone removed from the tomb.</p>

<p>Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The other disciple arrived at the tomb first;
He saw the burial cloths there</p>

<p>Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth that had covered his head,</p>

<p>Then the other disciple also went in,
and he saw and believed.</p>

<p>For they did not yet understand the Scripture
that he had to rise from the dead.</p>

<p>Church on Easter Sunday, this scripture is repeating what Jesus said in Matthew 18 verse 20.</p>

<p>“For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”</p>

<p>They all went to the tomb and eventually made it to the church.</p>

<p>This pandemic is highlighting something that deeply concerns me.</p>

<p>More and more we are gathering for funerals</p>

<p>And today, when you think about it, people are risking their life in order to go to a funeral. In other words, to do what I want to do.</p>

<p>Mary of Magdala went to see the tomb.</p>

<p>When she got there and saw the stone rolled away,</p>

<p>She wasn’t expecting that,</p>

<p>She had not considered that,</p>

<p>She didn’t know what to do with that</p>

<p>So, she did what? She high tailed it out of there.</p>

<p>Peter and the other disciple came to the tomb to see what was up in there. These were nosey men.</p>

<p>So, we have the dutiful, don’t start none, won’t be none, woman</p>

<p>And the nosey men meeting at the cemetery.</p>

<p>And in the middle of the meeting</p>

<p>Something happened</p>

<p>Mary let go of her logic.</p>

<p>Logically, something was wrong</p>

<p>Something was foul</p>

<p>And when John met her at the cemetery</p>

<p>His fear stopped him, but his curiosity got the best of him.</p>

<p>Then came Johnny come lately, the wonderkin, the rock star, Peter.</p>

<p>He came to fix this thing.</p>

<p>But he went in first and allowed the other two the comfort of following him,</p>

<p>and with no real explanation</p>

<p>He let go of his need to be in control and to have things his way</p>

<p>and he humbled Mary</p>

<p>and peaked John’s curiously by showing them that not only was the burial cloth and head dress still in the tomb,</p>

<p>they were rolled up and put away.</p>

<p>Peter said, this is not the work of a ne’re-do-well. This is the work of somebody who had an excellent mother and amazing home training.  He opened their eyes to something mysterious.</p>

<p>And that’s when it happened.</p>

<p>Not by one, not by two, but by two or more gathered in His name.</p>

<p>They thought they were gathering at the tomb</p>

<p>And Jesus did his thing and turned that gathering into a church.</p>

<p>Church he will do it in your living room if you let him</p>

<p>He will do it in your kitchen</p>

<p>He will do it when you are a camera-ready baby and he will do it when you are a casket sharp young man.</p>

<p>All it takes is a small gathering and some good home training and a little bit of mystery, and God has got a ball-game going on that could capture the attention of the whole world.</p>

<p>An Easter Sunday during a pandemic it doesn’t get any better than this to get it right.</p>

<p>If two or more of us kind find the time to just think about it,</p>

<p>Just wonder about it, just be about it, something good is going to come out of all the tombs of life.</p>

<p>Something someone tried to bury out of fear is going to rise up and save lives.</p>

<p>Something God given is going to pick us up, turn us around, and place our feet on solid ground and we will never show up to a church for a funeral again.</p>

<p>We will show up to a church because somebody was raised from the dead.</p>

<p>We will we show up to a church because somebody lived, not because they died.</p>

<p>It’s Easter Sunday, and here we are gathered by invisible, electric, particles of light.</p>

<p>The scientists tell us that these energetic gamma rays, after billions of collisions with matter, this radiation reaches us after something between 100,000 years and 50 million years ago.</p>

<p>The church tells us the mystery continues.</p>

<p>Today I clicked on a link and I was in church.</p>

<p>Happy Easter from Saint Benedict the African Parish,</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in Englewood.</p>

<p>Keep clicking on the link</p>

<p>Keep believing that when we link together</p>

<p>God Zooms</p>

<p>People get baptized</p>

<p>The Word gets proclaimed</p>

<p>Prayers get sung</p>

<p>And somehow, we get communion.</p>

<p>God is talking this Easter</p>

<p>To a church of people who like to say we always did it this way</p>

<p>And he is clearly saying</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I’ve been doing this for longer than you know.</p>

<p>I’ve been getting you to church for longer than you know.</p>

<p>Your 20/20 vision is not perfect, but it’s enough for you to see me.</p>

<p>In Easter God says, trust me, you are not ready for all of this</p>

<p>I’m going to let you see the empty tomb and figure out that</p>

<p>He ain’t dead.</p>

<p>So someday, one glad morning before this life is over,</p>

<p>You can see how to live right and stop living a live where your best gathering is a Facebook funeral for everybody who went to school with you and your birthday parties will be for everybody who came to church with you.</p>

<p>Mary, John and Peter tried to go to that tomb to keep the funeral going.</p>

<p>Jesus turned it into a surprise party where you walk away with the greatest mystery novel ever.</p>

<p>Happy Easter church!</p>

<p>We don’t know what tomorrow brings, but we do know that God is light years ahead of us.</p>

<p>We may have to start wearing sun-glasses in church because</p>

<p>God is alive and brilliant.</p>

<p>Keep clicking on the link that makes us church and keep following the man who was raised from the dead.</p>

<p>Keep being amazed!</p>

<p>Mark the day the school closed</p>

<p>Mark the day of the shutdown of the church</p>

<p>Mark the day of the shelter in place order</p>

<p>Mark the day you stopped going out in public</p>

<p>Mark the day somebody coughed and you jumped</p>

<p>Mark the day somebody sneezed and you ran</p>

<p>Mark the day of the reopening</p>

<p>Don’t forget to re-mark the day of Easter</p>
