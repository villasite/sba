I"≈<p>If Jesus was born without sin, why did he have to get baptized? First it is important to note that he didn‚Äôt have to, he wanted to.

<p>It is also important to understand that in doing so, getting baptized, Jesus changed and troubled the water! He changed baptism!</p>

<p>As John said, baptism was for repentance. To be washed clean was refreshing. Jesus came along and said to John baptize me.</p>

<p>‚Äú..it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.‚Äù</p>

<p>Now after Jesus, just like everything else, after Jesus everything has changed. Baptism now does more than cleanse one from sin, it unites all who are baptized with the Lord.</p>

<p>Now baptism is about perfect submission to the will of God. It is about becoming and being a member of God‚Äôs family.</p>

<p>It is about joining the church, the group of believers who have decided to follow Jesus.</p>

<p>It is about doing what the Lord would do so that ‚Äúthy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.‚Äù</p>

<p>Right after Jesus got baptized he went to work for the church. He began his public ministry.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that our sins are forgiven, so that we can do what Jesus would do, forget about our selves, concentrate on Him, worship Him and follow the leader, follow the Lord.</p>

<p>Today is good day to reconcile that we come to church so the Lord can work on us so we can work with the Lord.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt want no trouble at the river? Get to work!</p>
