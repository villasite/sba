    <p>The season is four weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose is to prepare for the Lord</p>
  </li>

    <p>The color is purple for prayer, not Lenten penance. Rose on the Third Sunday, Gaudete Sunday, is for joy. Think of the Resurrection! Hopefully, by this time there‚Äôs a great sense of ‚Äúwe have come this far by faith‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs beginning to look a lot like Christmas.‚Äù No sense in turning back!

    <p>The Advent Wreath - Traditionally, Advent wreaths are constructed of a circle of evergreen branches into which four candles are inserted, representing the four weeks of Advent. Ideally, three candles are purple and one is rose, but white candles can also be used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The progressive lighting of the candles symbolizes the growing expectation and hope surrounding the Lord‚Äôs coming.</p>

    <p><strong>Son of God</strong>: Advent is a time of preparation for the SECOND COMING of the SON of GOD. The Judgement day. A time of JOY upon which we wait, place our hope and trust. It is why we practice our faith. There would be no reason to have faith, if we did not BELIEVE in this time. While some may fear judgement day, those who are prepared shall rejoice. Depending on who you are, it will be the best or worse day of your life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Son of Man</strong>: Advent is a time of preparation for the FIRST COMING of the SON of GOD as the SON of MAN, the INCARNATION, Merry CHRISTmas. Giving presents is a sign of the living God and a symbol of God‚Äôs love. If you know someone who is just shopping this season, give him or her an invitation to Christmas Mass.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The Advent Candles listen to the scripture readings of Advent.</p>
