<p>Thank you for deciding to virtually join us for Sunday Mass at St. Benedict the African. Due to the temporary parish closure stemming from COVID-19 but the need to continue celebrating Mass as community, St. Benedict the African has decided to use the Zoom video conference platform to bring the Mass from the parish building to you.</p>

<p>We will be transmitting video and audio of the Mass which you can connect to with your mobile phone or landline telephone.</p>

<p>You will be joining a video conference session where you can see the Mass at the parish along with the other participants.</p>

<p>Please refer to the following guidance to assist your connection experience.</p>

<p>On the day of, either click on the meeting link (https://bit.ly/SBAparishMass) or enter the meeting ID after loading the app. Meeting ID: 979 480 457</p>

<p>There are two view options, which you can control at the top right of the screen. “Speaker View” will have the person speaking with the biggest video, in this case, the folks in the sanctuary. The other option is “Gallery View” which allows you to see everyone participating in the Mass, Brady Bunch style.</p>

<p>Our default will be to have everyone on the call muted, as there will be many people, some with background noise, in order to maximize everyone’s Mass experience. If you’d like to raise an issue, or contribute an intention, please utilize the chat function, which you can access through the bottom right of your screen.</p>

<p>Given that we expect a number of people to join us, you may experience the video or audio feed as choppy at times, this is normal &amp; please be patient as we continue to smooth out all the bumps in the road.</p>
